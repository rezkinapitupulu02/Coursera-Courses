    "\n",
    "In this module you’ll learn about different data types in Python, how to identify them, and how to convert between them. You’ll also learn how to use variables to assign data and to reference variables. You’ll deep dive into functions: how to define them, pass them parameters, and have them return information. You’ll explore the concepts of code reuse, code style, and refactoring complex code, along with effectively using code comments. Finally, you’ll learn about comparing data using equality and logical operators, and leveraging these to build complex branching scripts using if statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "* Differentiate and convert between different data types utilizing variables\n",
    "* Define and call functions utilizing parameters and return data\n",
    "* Refactor code and write comments to reduce complexity and enhance code readability and code reuse\n",
    "* Compare values using equality operators and logical operators\n",
    "* Build complex branching scripts utilizing if, else and elif statements"

    "In Python, text in between quotes -- either single or double quotes -- is a string data type. An integer is a whole number, without a fraction, while a float is a real number that can contain a fractional part. For example, 1, 7, 342 are all integers, while 5.3, 3.14159 and 6.0 are all floats. When attempting to mix incompatible data types, you may encounter a TypeError. You can always check the data type of something using the type() function."
