# Introduction to ML Strategy

- Course focus: Structuring machine learning projects and machine learning strategy.
- Goal: Learn to quickly and efficiently improve machine learning systems.
- Motivating example: Working on a cat classification project with 90% accuracy, aiming for higher performance.
- Ideas for improvement:
-- Collecting more diverse training data, including images of cats in different poses and varied negative examples.
-- Experimenting with longer training duration using gradient descent or alternative optimization algorithms like Adam.
-- Trying different network sizes, dropout, L2 regularization, and modifying network architecture.
- Importance of choosing effective strategies: Poor choices can lead to wasted time and effort.
- Course objectives: Teach strategies to analyze machine learning problems and identify promising approaches.
- Unique course materials: Sharing lessons from building and deploying numerous deep learning products.
- Evolution of machine learning strategy in the era of deep learning.
- Hope to enhance effectiveness in developing deep learning systems.
