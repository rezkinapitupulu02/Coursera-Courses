# About

Welcome to my GitHub repository! My name is Rezki Ciarchi Frendi Napitupulu, and I'm a final year industrial engineering student at ITB. I enthusiastically joined BANGKIT 2023 as part of the machine learning cohort to expand my knowledge of the current industry trend: AI.

Throughout the BANGKIT program, I had the opportunity to dive into various domains of data science and machine learning. I completed courses on data analytics, IT automation, and the complete spectrum of machine learning, covering topics such as mathematical foundations, TensorFlow, model deployment, and model structure, all through the comprehensive offerings available on Coursera.

This repository serves as a platform for me to share my journey and showcase the projects I have undertaken during my time in BANGKIT. Here, you will find a collection of my work, ranging from data analytics and automation scripts to machine learning models and their deployments. I hope that my contributions inspire fellow learners and provide valuable insights into the world of data science and machine learning.

Thank you for visiting my repository, and please feel free to explore the projects, leave feedback, and connect with me. Let's continue to learn and grow together in this exciting field!
